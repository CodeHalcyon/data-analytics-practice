# Car Data Analysis and Price Prediction 🚗📊

This project covers the complete pipeline of working with car-related data — starting from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to building a machine learning model for predicting car prices.

It consists of two main stages:
- **Data Preprocessing & Analysis** (`car.ipynb`)
- **Price Prediction Model** (`carpriceprediction.ipynb`)

---

## 🔍 1. Data Preprocessing and Analysis (`car.ipynb`)

The first phase focuses on understanding and cleaning the raw data.

### Key Steps:
- Loads the dataset (`car.csv`) using `pandas`
- Identifies and summarizes categorical features
- Drops irrelevant or redundant columns like `PostedDate` and `AdditionInfo`
- Prepares the dataset for modeling
- Uses `seaborn` for visual analysis

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (imported for future modeling)

## 🤖 2. Car Price Prediction (`carpriceprediction.ipynb`)

The second phase moves into machine learning for car price prediction.

### Expected Workflow:
- Load the cleaned dataset
- Perform feature engineering and encoding
- Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
